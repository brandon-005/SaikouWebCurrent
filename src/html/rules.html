		<!-- RULES SUMMARY -->
		<section class="rules-summary">

				<h3>Updated December 22, 2022</h3>
				<h1>Community Rules</h1>
				<p>
					We built our games for players to have fun. Creating a safe and
					enjoyable environment for everyone is a crucial part of what we're
					about, and these rules are what we ask and expect players to abide by
					to achieve this.<br /><br />The
					<a
						href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004647846-Roblox-Terms-of-Use"
						>Roblox Terms of Service</a
					>
					contain rules that apply to your use of Saikou's games, so some of
					these rules may look familiar. However, Saikou offers so many ways to
					interact with others through its games that it benefits from an
					additional level of explanation as a helpful resource.<br /><br />Our
					Community Rules apply to ALL players of Saikou's games. These
					standards are a guide on how you should interact within our
					incredible, globe-spanning community. Just because something isn't
					explicitly called out below doesn't mean it's OK. We all bring
					something unique, and that uniqueness is worth protecting.<br /><br />As
					these rules apply to everyone, it's also vital that you do not
					encourage, help, or support others in breaking these rules. It's never
					fun to lose access to games, but know that we do so to help ensure a
					positive gaming experience for our community when we put restrictions
					in place.

		<!-- RULES CONTENT -->
		<section class="rules-content">
			<div class="content-container">
				<!-- PERSONAL INFORMATION RULE -->
				<h2>Personal Information</h2>
				<p>
					The Saikou community runs on trust, and we must protect the privacy of
					our players. We take this responsibility seriously, and we won't
					tolerate behaviour or content that puts the privacy or security of
					another player at risk. Following this, you're never allowed to share
					other people's personal information. Threatening to share someone's
					real-world location, real name, etc. is also not allowed.
				</p>

				<!-- DISCRIMINATION RULE -->
				<h2>Intolerance and Discrimination</h2>
				<p>
					Hate and discrimination come in many forms, but none have a home here.
					To make the Saikou community a place where everyone can hang out and
					feel welcomed, we all need to play our part. This means keeping in
					mind how players could interpret your messages and leaving those
					unsavoury jokes outside the community. The Saikou community welcomes
					diversity in race, ethnicity, colour, religion, gender identity, and
					other groups. We won't stand for demeaning, marginalising or
					belittling content and will immediately take the necessary action.
				</p>

				<!-- CHEATING RULE -->
				<h2>Cheating</h2>
				<p>
					Saikou builds its games to be played moderately and within the rules.
					Cheating, griefing, or exploiting bugs and glitches is not allowed,
					along with promoting or advertising known cheats, bugs, or exploits.
					Exploiting known glitches or cheating doesn't just affect Saikou.
					These actions also inhibit the ability of Saikou to provide the best
					possible gaming experience to players around the world. If you
					encounter someone cheating or using bugs as a means of gaining an
					unfair advantage, report it on our Discord server.
