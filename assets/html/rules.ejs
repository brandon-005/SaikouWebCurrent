					<h3>Updated July 4, 2023</h3>
					<h1>Community Rules</h1>
					<p>
						We built our games for players to have fun. Creating a safe and
						enjoyable environment for everyone is a crucial part of what we're
						about, and these rules are what we ask and expect players to abide
						by to achieve this.<br /><br />The
						<a

						contain rules that apply to your use of Saikou's games, so some of
						these rules may look familiar. However, Saikou offers so many ways
						to interact with others through its games that it benefits from an
						additional level of explanation as a helpful resource.<br /><br />Our
						Community Rules apply to ALL players of Saikou's games. These
						standards guide how you should interact within our incredible,
						globe-spanning community. Remember that if something is not
						explicitly mentioned below, it does not necessarily mean it is
						acceptable. We all bring something unique, and that uniqueness is
						worth protecting.<br /><br />As these rules apply to everyone, it's
						also vital that you do not encourage, help, or support others in
						breaking these rules. It's never fun to lose access to games, but
						know that we do so to help ensure a positive gaming experience for
						our community when we put restrictions in place.

		<!-- RULES CONTENT -->
		<section class="rules-content">
			<div class="content-container">
				<div class="container">
					<!-- PERSONAL INFORMATION RULE -->
					<h2>Personal Information</h2>
					<p>
						At the heart of the Saikou community is a culture of trust and
						respect, and safeguarding the privacy of our players is a crucial
						responsibility that we take very seriously. We have a zero-tolerance
						policy towards any behaviour or content that compromises the privacy
						or security of our members. In line with this principle, we strictly
						prohibit sharing other players' personal information, including
						their real-world location, name, or any further identifying details.
						Threatening to reveal such information is also strictly prohibited,
						as it can cause harm and distress to the affected player and
						compromise the safety and security of our community.
					</p>

					<!-- DISCRIMINATION RULE -->
					<h2>Intolerance and Discrimination</h2>
					<p>
						Hate and discrimination come in many forms, but none have a home
						here. We all need to play our part to make the Saikou community a
						place where everyone can hang out and feel welcomed. When
						communicating with others in the community, you must be mindful of
						how your messages could be interpreted and avoid making unsavoury
						jokes. The Saikou community welcomes diversity in race, ethnicity,
						colour, religion, gender identity, and other groups. We won't stand
						for demeaning, marginalising or belittling content and will
						immediately take the necessary action.
					</p>

					<!-- CHEATING RULE -->
					<h2>Cheating</h2>
					<p>
						Saikou builds its games to be played moderately and within the
						rules. Cheating, griefing, or exploiting bugs and glitches are
						prohibited, along with promoting or advertising known cheats, bugs,
						or exploits. Exploiting known glitches or cheating doesn't just
						affect Saikou. These actions also inhibit the ability of Saikou to
						provide the best possible gaming experience to players worldwide. If
						you encounter someone cheating or using bugs to gain an unfair
						advantage, report it on our
						<a
							href="https://discord.gg/saikou"
							target="_blank"
							rel="noopener noreferrer"
							>Discord</a
						>
						server.
					</p>

					<!-- INSULTING AND HARASSMENT RULE -->
					<h2>Insulting and Harassment</h2>
					<p>
						The Saikou community is yours, but it's everyone else's too. We
						encourage showing off what makes you unique and extraordinary.
						However, it's not cool to do it at the expense of others and prevent
						positive experiences. In essence, respect others when chatting,
						playing, or communicating. Interacting in a threatening, insulting,
						demeaning, derogatory or abusive way is against the rules. Trying to
						bypass implemented chat filters to display sensitive content towards
						others is also strictly against our guidelines. We're all here to
						have a fun and enjoyable experience, and it is much better to leave
						any harsh feelings behind and game on!
					</p>

					<!-- IMPERSONATION RULE -->
					<h2>Impersonation</h2>
					<p>
						We understand that some players may aspire to be specific
						individuals, and that's okay. However, we draw the line when you
						pretend to be someone else, whether it be another player, a creator,
						a Saikou employee, or anyone else. Impersonating another person to
						deceive or defraud others is strictly prohibited. This includes but
						is not limited to using someone else's name, image, or other
						personal information without their consent or claiming to be someone
						else to access restricted areas or data.
					</p>

					<!-- CONSEQUENCES SECTION -->
					<h2>Consequences</h2>
					<p>
						Our priority is the safety of everyone in the Saikou community.
						Content and behaviour that puts players at risk or makes them feel
						unwelcome is not tolerated. So sometimes, we need to step in. We're
						not out to punish but rather to protect everyone's experience. The
						type of action we'll take for an offence varies on a case-by-case
						basis. We consider factors such as whether the player is a repeat
						offender, the severity of the infraction, and more, to issue a
						justified and corrective punishment. Action taken can be anything
						from a warning for less severe violations to a permanent account
						ban.<br /><br />Players who get permanently banned from a Saikou
						game may lose all rights to virtual items, statistics or other items
						that may have been earned or purchased. If that player has multiple
						accounts or uses them to evade punishment, we will also take action
						against those accounts. We also strive to provide a path to reform
						by every penalty or other corrective action showing what was wrong
						and what can be learnt from the situation. However, we don't do this
						at the expense of protecting the rest of the community. When a
						punishment ends, we welcome players back to contribute positively to
						our platforms if applicable. We know people make mistakes, and
						lapses in judgement can be a significant opportunity for growth and
						character development.
					</p>

					<!-- PLAYER REPORTING SECTION -->
					<h2>Player Reporting</h2>
					<p>
						We're all a part of this community, and it's up to us to keep it
						friendly, fun, and negativity-free. Like everyone else, you deserve
						a place to be yourself with confidence, so it's important to treat
						others as they would like to be treated. If you encounter a player
						not upholding the Community Rules or Roblox Terms of Service, we
						heavily encourage you to help us by reporting them on our
						<a
							href="https://discord.gg/saikou"
							target="_blank"
							rel="noopener noreferrer"
							>Discord</a
						>
						server.<br /><br />We will take action against players we observe
						not following the rules and escalate based on the offence. Whilst
						we're a community that brings people together, we understand that
						only some get along. If you meet someone, you don't like, but they
						aren't violating the Community Rules, you can
